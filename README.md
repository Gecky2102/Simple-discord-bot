## Installation  

Before you start, make sure to install the following dependencies and tools:  

### 1. Install Python Libraries  

The bot requires some Python libraries to run properly. You can install them by running the following command in your terminal:  

```bash
pip install discord.py aiohttp spotipy yt-dlp python-dotenv
```

#### Libraries:  
- `discord.py`: The library for interacting with Discord‚Äôs API.  
- `aiohttp`: Used for asynchronous HTTP requests.  
- `spotipy`: The Spotify API wrapper to interact with Spotify for playing music.  
- `yt-dlp`: A tool to download and stream audio from YouTube (used for music playback).  
- `python-dotenv`: Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.  

### 2. Install FFMpeg  

The bot uses **FFmpeg** to handle audio streaming and music playback. Follow these steps to install it:  

#### Windows:
1. Download FFmpeg from the official website: [FFmpeg Windows Builds](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows).  
2. Extract the files and move them to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`).  
3. Add the FFmpeg bin directory to your system‚Äôs PATH variable:
   - Right-click on "This PC" and select "Properties".  
   - Click "Advanced system settings", then click "Environment Variables".  
   - Under "System variables", find the "Path" variable, select it, and click "Edit".  
   - Add the path to the `bin` folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`) to the list, and click "OK".  

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):  
Run the following command in your terminal to install FFmpeg:  
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### macOS:  
Use Homebrew to install FFmpeg:  
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

Once FFmpeg is installed, you can verify the installation by running:  
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

If FFmpeg is properly installed, it will show you the version information.

### 3. Set Up the `.env` File  

The bot uses environment variables to store sensitive information like your bot token and Spotify credentials. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project folder and add the following lines:  

```env
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
STAFF_ROLE_ID=your_staff_role_id
LOG_CHANNEL_ID=your_log_channel_id
FOOTER_TEXT=your_footer_text
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
```

Replace the placeholder values with your own:

- `TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token, which you can get by creating a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
- `STAFF_ROLE_ID`: The role ID for your staff members.  
- `LOG_CHANNEL_ID`: The ID of the channel where logs will be sent.  
- `FOOTER_TEXT`: The custom footer text for the bot's embeds.  
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: Your Spotify Client ID (get it by creating an app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)).  
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Spotify Client Secret (found on the same dashboard).

### 4. Run the Bot  

After installing the dependencies and configuring your `.env` file, you can start the bot by running the following command in your terminal:  

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot should now be up and running, ready to use on your Discord server!
